                        I’m Jesse, a fourth year Data Science and Environmental Science undergraduate student at Griffith University.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first computer I ever used was an old beige box PC running Windows 98.
                        My early exposure to computers had me hooked from the very beginning. I was fascinated by them intensely.
                        Throughout my childhood, through to teen-hood and now adulthood I have always been enthralled by the freedom 
                        and possibilities a computer provides. <br>
                        When I was 12, I got an opportunity to visit the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station (CGBAPS) in Tasmania.
                        This exposure to one of the most harsh and unforgiving landscapes imaginable immediately made me fall in love with the natural world. Still loving computers, I now returned home eager to experience more of the natural world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During high school I excelled at maths and found myself enjoying it so much that I thought it would be a good career choice.
                        I had considered math, physics, actuarial and engineering degrees but all failed to give my beloved exposure to nature.
                        The end of school was only a few months away when I saw Griffith University had just brought out a new double degree 
                        – a bachelor’s in environmental science and data science. 
                        Instantly I knew this was the blend of nature and computation that I was seeking. <br>
                        Shortly after finishing school and at the beginning of my tertiary studies I began employment at an aquaculture farm.
                        Still working there in my final year of university, this job has taught me numerous life skills that coupled with 
                        my education give me a great understanding of marine environments, efficient workflow, technical skills, communication and more. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Having always looked fondly upon my visit to CGBAPS due to the influence it had on my life I decided to contact the 
                        head officer in my final year to do industry placement. To my delight they were happy to take me in. 
                        Now having completed my time at the station I can say it truly taught me so much more than I was expecting 
                        to learn about science as well as myself. <br>
                        The work placement heavily revolved and solving various problems with Python. 
                        This included things like exploratory data analysis, the data science pipeline, microcontroller programming and 
                        classification/automation scripts. 
                        After working in the environmental realm for years this work placement was a fresh taste of what the data 
                        science aspect of my double degree has to offer. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Throughout these last few final months of my studies, I have been increasingly fascinated by machine learnings methods 
                        and artificial intelligence. Learning about and developing various machine learning models within my degree has 
                        shown me the massive potential this technology has to positively shape innovation in any field it is applied to. 
                        After my studies I aim to work in a data science (or similar) position and eagerly look forward to continuing my 
                        learning journey. My long-term career goals are rather malleable, but I always want to be working on something 
                        that gives back to the world and that I find great personal satisfaction with.

                        I studied a double degree of Environmental Science and Data Science. Within this program I learnt about many aspects of 
                        the scientific world including biology, chemistry, statistics, climate science, geographic mapping, programming, ecology, 
                        data analytics and more. This wide range of scientific knowledge has helped me have a well-rounded understanding of the 
                        scientific process and the natural world. <br><br>

                        Within my job as an environmental assistant at a Gold Coast based sand quarry I witness firsthand the real-world impact 
                        science has. This ranges from the proper protocol for neutralizing acid sulphate soils to the sand quality tests performed 
                        to ensure that a sand has the right composition for uses in construction. When working on testing soils from a new dredge 
                        location we take scattered samples over an area and use geographic information systems (GIS) to map where these samples 
                        have been taken. This process aligns with general scientific principles of controlling variables as well as keeping data 
                        archived so that information can be verified from any point in the future. <br><br>

                        As well as using my wide array of scientific knowledge at university and work, I also have many hobbies that involve 
                        scientific aspects. These hobbies keep me continually learning even when outside of the work and study life. Some of 
                        my hobbies include botany (particularly permaculture and urban gardening), freediving/spearfishing (learning marine 
                        biology & ecology) and working on cars (involves problem solving & engineering aspects). Through every aspect of my 
                        lifestyle science is never far away, which is why the learning outcome of understanding science will always benefit 
                        me now and in the future.<br><br>

                    <b1>
                        The threshold learning outcome (TLO) of inquiry and problem solving is imperative within the environmental management 
                        field as well as data science. This learning outcome is the ability to solve scientific problems by critically evaluating 
                        information from sources, designing/planning an investigation, selecting appropriate techniques, and drawing conclusions 
                        from recorded data. <br><br>

                        The above process has many similarities to the policy cycle which I have learnt and put into practice within my environmental 
                        management major. Within my studies I have read many policies that tackle both climate change mitigation and adaptation. 
                        Some of these policies include the carbon tax, emissions reduction fund and various vague greenhouse gas emissions goals. 
                        These polices all follow the general structure of the Inquiry and Problem Solving TLO outcomes. <br><br>
                        The policy cycle:
                        <image src="images/policy.png" width="550" height="300"></image>

                        Within these policies there is the problem definition phase whereby all relevant information is taken in from a variety 
                        of sources to determine if a problem is solvable by new policy. There is then the stage where the new policy is planned, 
                        after this a preferred and most efficient solution is chosen. After the policy is implemented, there is then ongoing 
                        evaluation to assess whether the policy is doing the desired job. <br><br>

                        I have done this process within an environmental audit report of The Spit master plan as well as a policy analysis report 
                        on the QCoast2100 program by the Queensland Government. <br><br>

            <p>TLO 4 - Communication</p><br>

            <div class="row about-me__content" data-aos="fade-up">

                    <b1>
                        The ability to communicate clearly and efficiently is highly important in the realm of both environmental management and 
                        data science applications. Scientific knowledge and research is of reduced impact when important issues cannot be 
                        effectively communicated to all relevant persons. Studying a degree which was partly in person and partly online forced 
                        me to develop effective communication with the teaching staff and other students. <br><br>

                        Throughout my studies I have worked on many reports which has helped me to practice scientific communication through a 
                        written media such as essays or reports. I have also written a lot of code during my time at university which has always 
                        contained clear communicative comments throughout. Within programming it is very important to have clear communication as 
                        the code always needs to be readable by a future user who may not understand the context or method in which it was 
                        originally written.  <br><br>

                        I have also worked in numerous group projects during my studies. These opportunities were fantastic in helping me develop 
                        my communication as groups had to be managed often with little or no in person interaction. <br><br>

                        A specific application of my ability to communicate science is through the exploratory data analysis report I created for 
                        my WIL placement. This 20-page report included explanations of scientific methods used in the data analysis process as well 
                        as a summary and suggestions section. This communication was vital in enabling the CSIRO scientists to make an informed 
                        decision about the validity and path forward for the Aerodyne CO2 isotopologue measuring instrument. <br><br>
                        My experience in effective communication is not limited to articulating quantitative data driven results but also more 
                        malleable things such as the interpretation of legislation. An example of this is my environmental audit report on the 
                        Spit master plan. This report contains clear and concise explanations of applicable legislation as well as having efficient 
                        methods to visualise the level of compliance the plan had with relevant legislation.<br><br>

                    <b1>
                        I began my tertiary studies at the beginning of 2019. The first year of university was largely what I expected.
                         I had the opportunity to attend all classes in person as well as ask questions of my tutors and lectures to get 
                         a deeper understanding of content. This all changed when university went online due to Covid-19 from 2020.<br>
                        In this time, I had to adapt quickly to be able to learn as well and efficiently from the distraction filled area 
                        that is my room. This involved planning goals for everyday as well as timetabling for myself periods of study and 
                        periods of leisure. It is also during this period I started working over 32 hours per week to support myself whilst 
                        studying and away from home. These last three years of work, study and social life balance has helped me grow massively 
                        in my own personal and professional learning journeys.<br>
                        As well as planning for my own study times and goals I have also completed various planning documents for specific 
                        assessment pieces within my courses. An example of one of these planning techniques is the creation of a Gantt chart 
                        for software project timelines.

                    <b1>
                        Another technique I have utilised multiple times within my degree are project planning documents. These documents outline 
                        things like the goals, scope, requirements, design and hierarchy of a project. These documents are instrumental in creating 
                        a piece of software that could otherwise easily get out of hand due to design creep.

                    <b1>
                        At the end of my first year studying at Griffith I moved out of my family home due to my family relocating to Tasmania. 
                        This provided me with a challenge as I was still enrolled at university and heavily connected with friends on the Gold 
                        Coast. I decided to stay living on the Gold Coast and find a rental house. <br><br>
                        
                        Quickly realising the true cost of the activities 
                        that truly make me happy such as camping trips, freediving and snorkelling, car modifications and team sports, I faced a 
                        tough choice. I could either give up on these activities and focus solely on university or I could attempt to balance a 
                        nearly full-time work schedule within the aquaculture industry whilst studying full-time. I opted for the latter.<br><br>
                            
                        Work and social life balance: <br>

                        During the past few years, I have been able to enjoy countless domestic holidays, Formula 1 races, a 4WD for superior 
                        camping trips and a great social life completely self-funded. All the while during this time I had a growing fascination 
                        with foreign cultures and travelling. During my studies I have been learning German and am at a fairly good conversational 
                        level. Most importantly to me on top of living the life I desire by managing my time effectively I have been able to save 
                        enough money to go on a graduation trip to Europe for one month.<br><br>     <br>

                        Not only is this trip a celebration of my hard work from the past four years, but it is also an opportunity for me to see 
                        if living in Europe (specifically Switzerland, of which I am a citizen) is a viable and desirable next move for me. 
                        Graduating this December is a big achievement for me, especially whilst growing as a person through several adversities. 
                        I believe the way in which I have balanced my study life with my greater goals demonstrates several desirable Griffith 
                        graduate attributes. These attributes include applied literacies, career management, continuous learning, global and 
                        cross-cultural perspectives, interpersonal skills, negotiation and conflict resolution, organisational membership, 
                        problem-solving and decision-making, research and self-management.<br><br>

                    <b1>
                        For my work integrated learning placement, I travelled to Tasmania to 24 days at the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) Cape 
                        Grim/Kennaook Baseline Air Pollution Station (CGBAPS). The office is located in Smithton, Tasmania and the air monitoring 
                        station is a 50-minute drive west in Woolworth, Tasmania (the north-west point of the state). I was aware of the station 
                        due to having family living in Smithton. To get this opportunity I emailed the head officer Sam Cleland, and he was pleased 
                        to have me complete my WIL placement at the station.  <br><br>

                        The BOM is a government agency in Australia that is responsible for providing official weather services. On top of this 
                        the BOM also has several climate research stations around Australia. The Cape Grim Baseline air pollution station is one 
                        of three premier baseline air pollution stations in the world. BAPS are responsible for collecting air quality data that 
                        is considered ‘baseline’. This means the air has not been significantly contaminated by any major industries or cities. <br><br>

                        During my time at the station I had three main projects. The first project was to perform an exploratory data analysis 
                        on a suspected faulty CO2 isotopologue instrument. My second major project was building a cloud classification script 
                        which classified and stored images of the sky at set intervals. This project was combined with a MAX-DOAS scattered light 
                        instrument to discover if any given spectra was taken whilst aimed at a cloudy or clear sky. My final major project was 
                        programming a Pi Pico microcontroller to automate calibration runs on a TEKRAN mercury analyser machine. <br><br>

                        As well as these major projects I learned and helped out on many daily, monthly and annual tasks at the station. These included 
                        things like the 10m air intake service and clean, anemometer servicing and calibration, rainfall samples, various 
                        filter change procedures, the BOM automatic weather station and many more. <br><br>
                        
                        This experience taught me so much about independent efficient work, the climate change research process, python programming, 
                        problem solving and more.<br><br>

                        I completed my three major projects within my 5 weeks at the station and at the end gave the officers a copy of my finished 
                        code repository. This finished code repository gave value to the industry partner as it provided solutions and answers to 
                        multiple underperforming or broken instruments at the station. Both my cloud classification script and microcontroller 
                        programs are applicable to stations across the globe who use the same technology. The officers at the station were very 
                        pleased with my work and assured me my microcontroller program and design would get put into use in other air quality 
                        stations – particularly a station in South Africa which had just purchased multiple TEKRAN mercury analysers. <br><br>

                        These projects wouldn’t be possible without the many courses I have studied at university that taught me about climate change,
                         data analysis and the python programming languages. Writing real-world applicable projects rather than practice exercises 
                         helps me truly learn about a process at a deeper level. <br>
